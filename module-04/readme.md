# Module 4: Javascript Fundamentals

Text: Eloquent Javascript, Second Edition
Read/review the Introduction + Chapters 1 & 2 by Thursday

## Concepts & Examples

- Binary, p.3
- What is Javascript, p. 6
- The six data types, p. 12

Get the code: Hop over to [https://github.com/wjmoner/imedia-production] and Download (big green button) the repository. You’ll find js-start in there. **FOR ANY NEW PROJECT, MAKE A COPY OF IT BEFORE PROCEEDING.** 

## Module 4.1: Operations

Due Thursday

1. Make a copy of the starter template
2. In the *init()* function, create a series of console.log() statements showing the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo
- Complex algebra (using parentheses & order of operations)

Use the format *console.log(statement)* line-by-line to show your work. 

## Module 4.2: Variables

Due Thursday

1. Make a copy of the starter template
2. Create two number variables, two string variables, and two boolean variables. *Hint: declare the variable and give it a value that corresponds to the data type you want*
3. In a conditional (if/else) statement, write a statement that indicates whether it’s raining. Report the results to the console using console.log(). You may write a conditional that compares the value of a boolean “raining”. In pseudocode:

IF raining is true
Print “It is raining” to the console
ELSE
Print “It is not raining!” 

## Module 4.3: Rock/Paper/Scissors Flowchart

Due Tuesday

Set up a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors (player vs. computer)
	- Write a flowchart to set up game flow
	- Account for player win, computer win, and tie

1. Identify variables to store information in the game. You’ll need to compare the selection made by the computer and the selection made by the player. 
2. Identify a clear START and END to the program (you might ask the user if they want to play again)

## Module 4.4: FizzBuzz 

Due Tuesday

See *Eloquent Javascript*, p. 38

## Module 4.5: Writing the Program for Rock/Paper/Scissors

1. Declare variables
2. Initialize the computer variable with a random choice
3. Populate the user variable
4. Write the gameplay script based on your flowchart using if/else statements and logic
5. Use console.log to produce output for your program.
