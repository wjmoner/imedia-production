## Module Assignment A 

Fall 2016: Assignment Due September 1  
Needs: 1 stack of 3”x3” Post-It Notes  

1. Read pp. 45 - 74 in Lev Manovich’s *Language of New Media*. 
2. When you encounter a term within the reading that is either **important** or **difficult**, jot it down on a Post-It note. You will have two stacks at the end of this exercise: one stack for important or crucial points, and the other for difficult or challenging points in the reading. 
3. Create as many individual notes as possible. Think of these as *nodes* that capture one key point per sticky note. Write large, clear, legible notes. If a sticky note contains two concepts, separate those out into individual concepts. For instance, *variability* can appear on a single note, but “GIF and JPEG images” may need to be simplified to “GIF” one one note and “JPEG” on a second. 
4. Bring your stack of Post-It notes to class. Initial the back (sticky side) of every note you create (e.g. “TS” for Tony Stark or Taylor Swift). 

## Module Assignment B

Fall 2016: Assignment Due September 6  
Needs: 1 or 2 8.5” x 11” sheets of plain white paper

For this assignment, *hand*write pseudocode and produce a flowchart for the game Tic-Tac-Toe (or as the British call it, naughts and crosses). 

Follow this process:

1. Read Murray, *Inventing the Medium*, Introduction and Chapter 2. 
2. Based on the exercise suggested in the section “Scripting the Interactor,” produce a unique hand-written procedure for the game “Tic-Tac-Toe” using pseudocode. Use the book as a starting point, but focus on the clarity of your own thoughts. 
3. Create a flowchart based on the pseudocode you wrote.
4. Bring both sheets to class with you.
