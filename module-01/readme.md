## Module Assignment 1 

Needs: 1 stack of 3”x3” Post-It Notes

1. Read pp. 45 - 74 in Lev Manovich’s *Language of New Media*. 
2. When you encounter a term within the reading that is either **important** or **difficult**, jot it down on a Post-It note. You will have two stacks at the end of this exercise: one stack for important or crucial points, and the other for difficult or challenging points in the reading. 
3. Create as many individual notes as possible. Think of these as *nodes* that capture one key point per sticky note. Write large, clear, legible notes. If a sticky note contains two concepts, separate those out into individual concepts. For instance, *variability* can appear on a single note, but “GIF and JPEG images” may need to be simplified to “GIF” one one note and “JPEG” on a second. 
4. Bring your stack of Post-It notes to class.
