### Course Description

This course covers the fundamental practices associated with interactive media production, including interface design, applied multimedia and usability refinement. In the effort to provide users with optimized opportunities for choice and control, students will apply design guidelines such as Shneiderman’s eight Golden Rules and production/design trends emerging in various industries. Students will author interactive experiences and explore historical origins as well as today’s best practices.

### Course Goal

Understand fundamental interactive media development concepts using common industry development tools in order to reinforce technique that may be applied beyond the scope of this course. Emerge with enhanced technical skills and theoretically-informed insights into interactivity and its increasingly significant role in a variety of communications contexts.

### Course Objectives

Javascript: several small, functional projects will be completed  

Interactive Media: HTML5 Canvas Game + Web Audio Project + Eko Video Project  

Final Project: A fully-functional game or interactive media project fulfilling a specific objective, using a Javascript framework such as jQuery, D3.js, or HTML5 game frameworks

Wordpress: your course portfolio and process documentation will be stored here, under your complete control using specific themes, child themes, and plugins (ongoing) 

Journal: part of Wordpress, journal entries are for reflection and growth  

Future Tech Panels: exploring new dimensions of interactive media (after fall break)
