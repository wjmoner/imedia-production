# Troubleshooting Tips

## Before asking for help…

1. Investigate the problem. Use the Chrome console to view errors (CMD-SHIFT-J).
2. Common difficulties:
- Did you end your statement with a semicolon? 
- Did you place a semicolon somewhere where it shouldn’t be?
- Did you include all required script files including HTML, CSS, Javascript

## If you’re stuck…

1. Send screenshots (via email) or use Quicktime Player to Record your Screen and share the video via a Google Drive shared file/folder or via Dropbox (not by email due to attachment size)
2. Provide as much detail as possible, including *all* code you’re attempting to use
3. Send me *all* code in the project you’re troubleshooting
4. Send *all* errors appearing in the Javascript console (CMD-SHIFT-J in Chrome)
